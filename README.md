Software Re-Engineering (ArgoUML Code C#,CPP,JAVA) | Code Quality | Code Description | Graphs | Codacy | Code Scene | Deep Sourse | Codeac | Code Factor

Downloaded the source code for ArgoUML in three distinct programming languages from the following repositories:

1. [ArgoUML Repository](https://github.com/orgs/argouml-tigris-org/repositories)
2. [ArgoUML C++ Repository](https://github.com/argouml-tigris-org/argouml-cpp)
3. [ArgoUML C# Repository](https://argouml-tigris-org.github.io/tigris/argouml-csharp/)

Conduct code quality analysis using these following tools for ArgoUML:

1. [CodeScene](https://codescene.io/)
2. [Codeac](https://www.codeac.io/)
3. [CodeFactor](https://www.codefactor.io/)
4. [DeepSource](https://deepsource.io/)
5. [Codacy](https://www.codacy.com/)

Generate reports for each tool to provide comprehensive insights into the project's codebase. Include information on features, bugs, and release reports for the project.

Additionally, identify common patterns present across all project releases, offering a deeper understanding of the consistent elements within the development history of ArgoUML.
